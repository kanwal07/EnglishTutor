It's a basic android app with connection to firebase database.
Through this app the user can practice their english language tenses.
In this application I have used- variable bindings, fragments, recycle layouts, many classes and activities,
different layout designs(with and without photos).
Login and Register is connected to the database and works perfectly.
All in all, a simple and small android app.
My first fully working application.
